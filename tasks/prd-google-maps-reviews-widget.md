The plugin will scrape review data directly from the Google Maps business URL (without requiring API access), making it accessible to all users regardless of technical expertise or API limitations. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use solution for businesses to showcase their Google reviews as social proof on their websites.

## Goals

1. **Easy Integration**: Provide a simple widget and shortcode that can be added to any WordPress page or post
2. **No API Required**: Fetch reviews directly from Google Maps business URLs without requiring Google API setup

4. **Customizable Display**: Allow users to choose display format, filter reviews, and customize appearance
5. **Reliable Performance**: Handle edge cases gracefully and provide fallback options for errors
6. **User-Friendly**: Require minimal technical knowledge to set up and use
